== Servlet Interceptor

As the name implies, the servlet interceptor is both a servlet and an
interceptor. It is created when an application calls
`io.pedestal.http/create-server` or `io.pedestal.http/create-servlet`.

The servlet interceptor is a link:chain-providers[chain provider] that
invokes interceptors when an HTTP request arrives.

The servlet interceptor sets up the link:context-map[context map] and
the link:request-map[request map]. It looks for the
link:response-map[response map] after all interceptors have finished.
