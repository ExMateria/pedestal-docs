== Description

A chain of interceptors can be used for any kind of pipelined
processing with branching decisions. It is not limited to HTTP request
handling. There are some keys that the link:chain-provider[chain
provider] expectes to find in the context map.

Any key not described here is officially undefined and should be
regarded as an implementation detail subject to change.

[cols="s,d,d", options="header", grid="rows"]
|===
| Key | Type | Description

| :io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/queue
| Stack of interceptors
| This is the interceptor stack that the chain provider uses. You can inspect this for debugging purposes, but to manipulate it you should call `io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/enqueue`, `io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/terminate`, or `io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/terminate-when`.

| :io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/execution-id
| Opaque
| This identifier is set uniquely when the pipeline is invoked. It is useful for correlating log files. Do not assume anything about the structure or type of this identifier.

| :io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/error
| Exception
| When error processing is invoked, this value is the most recent exception that triggered error handling.

== As Applied to HTTP

When used with Pedestal's HTTP handling, there are additional keys of
interest.  The context map is created before the first interceptor is
invoked. It describes the context of the interceptor execution
itself. When the execution chain is connected to an HTTP server, the
`:request` and `:response` keys have a special purpose.

Pedestal does not attach metadata to the request map.

When processing, take care to modify the map, rather than constructing
a new one. Interceptors may add arbitrary keys to the request map, so
it is important to preserve keys that your interceptor does not
specifically modify.

[cols="s,d,d", options="header", grid="rows"]
|===
| Key | Type | Deescription

| :request
| Request map
| See link:request-map[Request Map]

| :response
| Response map
| Only present if an interceptor has attached this. See link:response-map[Response Map]

|===

== Servlet Keys

The following keys are only present when using the
link:servlet-interceptor[Servlet Interceptor].

[cols="s,d,d", options="header", grid="rows"]
|===
| Key | Type | Description

| :servlet-request
| HttpServletRequest
| The request that was sent by the client. You should use the link:request-map[Request Map] rather than directly accessing this.

| :servlet-response
| HttpServletResponse
| The response object in which the HTTP server wants its response. You should use the link:response-map[Response Map] rather than directly accessing this.

| :servlet-config
| javax.servlet.ServletConfig
| The servlet configuration object.

| :servlet
| javax.servlet.Servlet
| The servlet itself.
