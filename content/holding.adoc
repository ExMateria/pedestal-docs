_This is stuff I've written that I want to put someplace, but haven't gotten to the right spot yet.__

== From Hello World

*Edited for length. Add this in a guide about starting from a template.*

Then we'll do the same thing but with power tools. We'll use a popular
build tool to create a project from a template. This one will have
some more bells and whistles to explore. We will look at what is
absolutely necessary, what is optional, and what benefits the template
offers.

Of course, nothing says you have to use this one official
template. Other people have set up their own templates, specialized
for different purposes. Since Pedestal is just a set of libraries, you
have a lot of flexibility in how you weave them together to make an
application. The link:../community/tutorials-guides-samples[Tutorials,
Guides, and Samples] page has links to some other templates that users
have created.
