== Using a Snapshot

If you want to try out the latest and greatest, you'll need to build
and install snapshot jars locally:

    lein sub install

== Checkout Instructions

All the code is in one repository, with subprojects for the different
modules. Just clone https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal and you are
good to go.

== Testing Pedestal Itself

If you're working on Pedestal itself, you can either test everything:

    lein sub test

Or just run `lein test` in the directory for the module you are
working on.
