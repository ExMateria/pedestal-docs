# Contribution Guidelines.

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Pedestal documentation!

The Pedestal Docs repository follows identical guidelines to the source projects, as such a signed CA is required for all contributions. Visit our [contribution page](http://pedestal.io/#contribute) for more information on the CA process.

We appreciate any and all submissions, but please remember Pedestal is very much a work in progress; we may make changes that invalidate or make obselete certain submissions. In particular, **the [app](github.com/pedestal/pedestal/app) is undergoing a major simplifying refactor**. This work should be done Summer of 2013 - please be considerate of this before pouring _too_ much time into that section.

**If you're planning on making a sizable contribution**: please consider opening an issue or WIP pull request for others to contribute and provide feedback.
