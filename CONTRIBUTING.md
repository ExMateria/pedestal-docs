# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Pedestal documentation!

The Pedestal Docs repository follows similar (but slightly different!) guidelines to our other repositories; substantial changes and new content still require a signed Contributors Agreement (CA), while typos and other minor changes do not.

Visit our [contribution page](http://pedestal.io/#contribute) for more information on the CA process and how to submit your own signed CA.

## Submissions

In general, we appreciate any and all submissions, but please remember Pedestal is very much a work in progress; we may make changes that invalidate or make obselete certain submissions.

### Major changes

We'd like to ask that anyone considering putting forth a substantial effort towards Pedestal documentation start that effort with a conversation. Open an [issue](https://github.com/pedestal/docs/issues) or send a message to 
the [pedestal-dev](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/pedestal-dev) list and let us know how you're interested in helping.

We'll acknowledge your request within a day or two, and let you know what we think shortly thereafter. After you've received go ahead and completed your work, open a pull request and we'll perform a final review before merging your changes.

While working on documentation we encourage you to ping Relevancers frequently for feedback; we're more than happy to help you write awesome documentation for our baby.

All substantive pull requests will required a signed [CA](http://pedestal.io/#contribute).

**Note**: We can tell you already [app](github.com/pedestal/pedestal/app) is undergoing major changes (2013-04-19). You're welcome to help document `app`, but please just wait a few more weeks :wink:.

### Typos and other minor changes

You are welcome to open pull requests for small changes like typo correction or grammer fixes without prior conversation.

We will accept these pull requests **without** a signed CA on file.
